# Writing Solid Ruby Code

## Books

* Software Tools
* Writing Solid Code
* Code Complete
* Object-Oriented Software Construction
* Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
* Extreme Programming Explained

## Write Tests

* Write tests as specifications
  * Necessary - Do the specs cover only the code in question?
  * Sufficient - Do the specs cover every behavior needed for this code?
* Make the specifications as readable as possible
  * rspec-given library

## Design by Contract

## Fortify your Subsystems

* Don't trust stuff coming from outside
  * User input, database, other software

## Step through your Code

* Pry
* Ruby Debugger

## Candy Machine Interfaces

* APIs where it's too easy to do the wrong thing

## Risky Business

* Cyclomatic complexity
* Don't be overly clever
* Bugs just don't go away
* Don't fix bugs later; fix them now!
* Fix the cause, not the symptom

## Your code is your responsibility
