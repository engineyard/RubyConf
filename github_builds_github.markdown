***This is not about Github. It's about the process.***

how      **your company**
uses     **github**
to build **your company**

## Work Asynchronously

* Do shit without needing to pull me out of **the zone**
* No meetings, no deadlines, ignore pings
* People don't have critical stuff every 10 seconds
* All communication in chatrooms
  * Everything is logged
  * Time flexibility
* Get people to work as they want to work naturally

## Pull Requests & Branching

* Y'all got some weird branches
* Everyone can push, everyone can deploy
* Frees up time from micromanaging someone else's code
* Master is **always** deployable
  * Deploy 10-40 times per day
  * Twitter-Driven Development
    * Deploy, check Twitter, roll-back if people complain
* You don't need to fork anything
* Tests can run on branches other than Master
* Email is your interface
* Designers can evolve mockups and entire workflows
* Mix designers and developers
  * Post screenshots `![title](url)`
* Can you survive on **simpler** tools?
* If it were really important, it would already by done. Period.
* Focus on the discussion and writing a good pull request
* Shared responsibility towards not fucking things up

* Don't reinvent the wheel
