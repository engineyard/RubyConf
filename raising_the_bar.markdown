## Writing Better Rubygems

* With almost 29,000 gems, we have many choices
* Overall need to improve quality of gems released

## Creating a Gem

* stardust.gem
* Code for gem goes in `lib/`
* `gem build stardust.gemspec`
* `gem push stardust-0.0.1.gem`

## Defining Conventions

* Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
  * Public API
  * X.Y.Z
  * Immutable
* Don't bump versions when submitting pull requests

## State of the Ecosystem

* Community Contributions
  * Don't skimp on this section
  * Contribution policy
* Writing and releasing gems is much easier since the move to rubygems.org
